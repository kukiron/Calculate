# Calculate

A simple calculator built with create-react-app for basic arithmetic. Adds a calculator icon to your browser toolbar. You can open the calculator while browsing any web page.

### Using the extension
To check out the repo, run the following (if you have Git & npm installed) from terminal:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/kukiron/Calculate.git
$ cd Calculate

```

Then upload the build folder in browser's developer mode. Or alternatively, you can download the .crx file & just drag it to the browser's (chrome or opera) extension page.
